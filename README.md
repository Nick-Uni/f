A handwritten character classifier that can fit in a tweet and still have some characters left for emojis.

~70% accuracy (not really competitive with state-of-the-art systems, but quite good for 120 characters of code).
The model is in the file named 'm' (I really wanted to save characters), and the algorithm is in 'predict.py'.
Vaguely resembles K-Nearest Neighbours, imho it's the shortest classification algorithm to implement.

Written as my final assignment for System Analysis and Decision course at the Uni.

Dependencies: numpy.
