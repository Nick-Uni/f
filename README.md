i just wanted to write a handwritten character classifier that would fit it a tweet and still have 20 characters left for funny emojis

~70% accuracy (not really competitive with state-of-the-art systems, but quite good for 120 characters of code)

the "model" is in the 'm' file (i really wanted to save characters)

dependencies: numpy
