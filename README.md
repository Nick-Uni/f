A handwritten character classifier that can fit it a tweet and still have some characters left for funny emojis.

~70% accuracy (not really competitive with state-of-the-art systems, but quite good for 120 characters of code).
The model is in the 'm' file (I really wanted to save characters), and the algorithm is in 'predict.py'.
Vaguely resembles K-Nearest Neighbours, imho it's the shortest classification algorithm to implement.

Dependencies: numpy.
